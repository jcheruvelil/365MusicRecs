## Project Propasal:
Our group wants to create an API that implements a music recommendation/review system. This API will allow users to rate albums/songs/artists and get recommendations 
based on their preferences. We want to allow various functionalities for the user including searching for artists/albums and creating playlists. Read operations for the API would include
fetching music recommendations, album/artist details, and playlists. Write operations would include rating songs, adding/removing songs from playlists, and managing user preferences.
